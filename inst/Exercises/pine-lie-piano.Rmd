TITLE GOES HERE: Describe in words what the following excerpt from an R Markdown file will display when rendered.

```
$\hat{y} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \cdot x + \epsilon$
```
 <!--begin-answer-->
The rendered file will display: $\hat{y} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \cdot x + \epsilon$.  The implication is that arbitrary LaTeX commands can be included in R Markdown files to format mathematical expressions.
