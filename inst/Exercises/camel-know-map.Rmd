TITLE GOES HERE: What impact does the random number seed have on our results?

a. Repeat the Census logistic regression model that controlled only for capital gains but using a different random number seed (365 instead of 364) for the 80%/20% split.  Would you expect big  differences in the accuracy using the training data?  Testing data?  

b. Repeat the process using a random number seed of 366.  What do you conclude?

But the results are anticipated to be very similar.

```{r }
