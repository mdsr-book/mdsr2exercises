TITLE GOES HERE: Consider the following data graphic. 

```{r mtcars-ex1, fig.asp = 0.35}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point()
```

The `am` variable takes the value `0` if the car has [automatic transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_transmission) and `1` if the car has [manual transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission).
How could you differentiate the cars in the graphic based on their transmission type?

<!--answer-start-->
Map the `color` aesthetic to the `am` variable.
