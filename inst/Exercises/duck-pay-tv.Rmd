TITLE GOES HERE: Consider the following queries:

XX BB ?? how should they know what is indexed?

```{r eval=FALSE, engine="mysql"}
SELECT * FROM flights WHERE cancelled = 1;
SELECT * FROM flights WHERE carrier = "DL";
```

Which query will execute faster? Justify your answer.


 <!--begin-answer-->
The latter is faster because there is an index built on `carrier`.
