TITLE GOES HERE: The `flights` table in the `airlines` database contains the following indexes:

```{sql, connection=mdsr::dbConnect_scidb("airlines")}
SHOW INDEXES FROM flights;
```

Consider the following queries:

```{sql, eval=FALSE}
SELECT * FROM flights WHERE cancelled = 1;
SELECT * FROM flights WHERE carrier = "DL";
```

Which query will execute faster? Justify your answer.


<!--begin-answer-->
The latter is faster because there is an index built on `carrier`.
Conversely, there is no index built on `cancelled`.
