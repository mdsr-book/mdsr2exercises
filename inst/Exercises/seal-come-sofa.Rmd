TITLE GOES HERE: The `date` function returns an indication of the current time and date.  What arguments does `date` take?  What kind of object is the result from `date`?  What kind of object is the result from `Sys.time`?

<!--begin-answer-->
The `date` function takes no arguments.  
```{r}
class(date())
class(date) # note that this is different!
class(Sys.time())
```

It returns a character string.  The `Sys.time` function returns an object of form POSIXct and POSIXlt.
