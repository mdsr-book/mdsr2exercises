TITLE GOES HERE: Consider an R Markdown file that includes the following code chunks.
What will be output when the file is rendered?


````markdown
`r ''````{r echo = FALSE}
x <- 1:5
```
````

````markdown
`r ''````{r echo = FALSE}
x <- x + 1
```
````

````markdown
`r ''````{r include = FALSE}
x
```
````

 <!--begin-answer-->

```{r echo=FALSE}
x <- 1:5
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
x <- x + 1
```

```{r include=FALSE}
x
```

This example yields no output (since the `include=FALSE` chunk option was set).  Note however,
that the command was run so any side effects would be observed later.
