```{r elm-hurt-dish-default, include = FALSE}
mdsr2exercises::setup()
library(tidyverse)
```

TITLE GOES HERE: Consider the following pipeline:

```{r eval = FALSE, error=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarize(avg_mpg = mean(mpg)) %>%
  filter(am == 1)
```

What is the problem with this pipeline?

<!--answer-start-->

There is no variable called `am` in the result of `summarize()`, because `am` does not appear in the calls to either `group_by()` or `summarize()`.
