TITLE GOES HERE: Why does the `r pkg_macro(mosaic)` package plain R Markdown template include the code chunk option `message=FALSE` when the `r pkg_macro(mosaic)` package is loaded?

 <!--begin-answer-->
By default the `r pkg_macro(mosaic)` package notes that a number of functions are masked.  Setting the
chunk option `message=FALSE` suppresses these messages.
