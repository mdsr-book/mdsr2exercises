(ref:zebra-teach-radio) Exercise in file zebra-teach-radio

```{r zebra-teach-radio-default, include = FALSE}
mdsr2exercises::setup()
```

TITLE GOES HERE: Consider the values returned by the `r mdsr2exercises::func_macro(as.numeric)` and `r mdsr2exercises::func_macro(parse_number)` functions when applied to the following vectors.  Describe the results and their implication.

```{r zebra-teach-radio-1, echo = TRUE}
x1 <- c("1900.45", "$1900.45", "1,900.45", "nearly $2000")
x2 <- as.factor(x1)
```

<!--begin-answer-->

```{r zebra-teach-radio-12, echo = TRUE, error=TRUE}
as.numeric(x1)
as.numeric(x2)
readr::parse_number(x1)
readr::parse_number(x2)
```

We see that as.numeric can't handle dollar signs, commas, or any extraneous text.  It's also  very confused by factors.
