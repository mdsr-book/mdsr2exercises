```{r giraffe-draw-clock-default, include = FALSE}
mdsr2exercises::setup()
```

TITLE GOES HERE: Use the `r mdsr2exercises::pkg_macro(fec12)` package to download the Federal Election Commission data for 2012. Re-create Figures 2.1 and 2.2 from the text using `r mdsr2exercises::pkg_macro(ggplot2)`. 

XX BB SOLUTION NEEDS TO BE UPDATED TO MATCH NEW FIGURES (which changes from first to second edition).
