TITLE GOES HERE: Use the `HELPrct` data from the `r pkg_macro(mosaicData)` to fit a tree model to the following predictors: `age`, `sex`, `cesd`, and `substance`.

a. Plot the resulting tree and interpret the results.

b. What is the accuracy of your decision tree?

 <!--begin-answer-->

```{r}
library(tidymodels)
library(mosaicData)
form <- formula("homeless ~ age + sex + cesd + substance")
mod_tree <- decision_tree(mode = "classification") %>%
   set_engine("rpart") %>%
   fit(form, data = HELPrct)
mod_tree
```

XX accuracy
