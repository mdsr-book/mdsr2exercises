TITLE GOES HERE: In the first example in the chapter, a training dataset of 80% of the rows was created for the Census data.
What would be the tradeoffs of using a 90%/10% split instead?

 <!--begin-answer-->
The 90%/10% split would use more of the data in training the dataset but have less to test.  
There would still, however, be 3,256 observations in the test dataset which may be sufficient to assess the model.
