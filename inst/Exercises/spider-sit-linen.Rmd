TITLE GOES HERE:	Using data from the `r pkg_macro(Lahman)` package, create a Shiny app that displays career leaderboards similar to the one at http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/HR_season.shtml. Allow the user to select a statistic of their choice, and to choose between `Career`, `Active`, `Progressive`, and `Yearly League` leaderboards. (Hint: examples of similar apps can be found at the [Shiny gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery).)
