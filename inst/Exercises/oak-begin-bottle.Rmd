TITLE GOES HERE: [Angelica Schuyler Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelica_Schuyler_Church) (1756--1814) was the daughter of New York Governer Philip Schuyler and sister of 
Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton.  Angelica, New York was named after her.  Using the `r pkg_macro(babynames)` package generate a plot of the reported proportion of babies born with the name Angelica over time and interpret the figure.

<!--begin-answer-->
```{r hamiltonsisters}
library(babynames)
angelica <- filter(babynames, name == "Angelica")
ggplot(data = angelica, aes(x = year, y = prop, color = sex)) +
  geom_line()
```
We see that there is a big jump in the number of babies named Angelica starting in the mid 1970's.
