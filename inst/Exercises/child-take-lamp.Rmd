TITLE GOES HERE: We saw that a 95% confidence interval for a mean was constructed by taking the estimate and adding and subtracting two standard deviations.  How many standard deviations should be used if a 99% confidence interval is desired?

 <!--begin-answer-->
If we assume that our sample size is sufficiently large, we can assume that the distribution of the 
sample means is approximately normal (if not true we need to use the appropriate $t$-distribution).  
```{r }
qnorm(1 - .01 / 2)
```
We need to multiple the standard deviation of the mean (standard error) by 2.58.
