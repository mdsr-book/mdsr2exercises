  <!--begin-answer-->

We critique [this graphic](http://www.npr.org/news/graphics/2012/09/pm-incometax/gr-pm-incometax3-462.gif) from the Tax Policy Center. 


  -  Color is a visual cue that is mapped to the categorical variable of taxpayer status. Angle is the visual cue that is mapped to the numeric variable of the percentage of people. This exploding pie chart uses a radial coordinate system, and the scale is percentage. 
  -  There are two variables: percentage of taxpayers, and reason taxpayer status.
  -  Aside from the common criticisms of pie charts in general, this pie chart makes two strange choices. First, the exploding nature of the pie chart (having pieces of the pie fall out of it) is pointless and distracting. Second, the use of color is odd. By using multiple shades of red, it implies an ordinal scale to the categorical variable of taxpayer status. But there is no logical ordering of this variable. Thus, a qualitative color scale would have been more appropriate.
