TITLE GOES HERE: The `RailTrail` data set from the `r pkg_macro(mosaicData)` package describes the usage of a rail trail in Western Massachusetts.
Use these data to answer the following questions.

a. Create a scatterplot of the number of crossings per day `volume` against the high temperature that day
b. Separate your plot into facets by `weekday` (an indicator of weekend/holiday vs. weekday)
c. Add regression lines to the two facets

<!--begin-answer-->

```{r }
library(mosaicData)
```

```{r railtrail-1}
ggplot(RailTrail, aes(x = hightemp, y = volume)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r railtrail-2}
ggplot(RailTrail, aes(x = hightemp, y = volume)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~weekday)
```

```{r railtrail-3, message = FALSE}
ggplot(RailTrail, aes(x = hightemp, y = volume)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~weekday) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```
