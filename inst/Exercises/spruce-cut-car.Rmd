```{r spruce-cut-car-default, include = FALSE}
mdsr2exercises::setup()
```

TITLE GOES HERE: For each of the following assignment statements, describe the error (or note why it does not generate an error).

```{r eval=FALSE}
result1 <- sqrt 10
result2 <-- "Hello to you!"
3result <- "Hello to you"
result4 <- "Hello to you
result5 <- date()
```

<!--begin-answer-->
The first statement is invalid (improper syntax for function argument).  The second uses an invalid assignment operator.
The third tries to assign to an invalid object name.  The fourth has unmatched quotes.  The last is correct.
