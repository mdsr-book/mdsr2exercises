TITLE GOES HERE: Alice is searching for cancelled flights in the `flights` table, and her query is running very slowly. She decides to build an index on `cancelled` in the hopes of speeding things up. Discuss the relative merits of her plan. What are the trade-offs? Will her query be any faster?


 <!--begin-answer-->
Because `cancelled` is a binary variable, and there are relatively few cancelled flights, this will likely speed up searches for cancelled flights considerably. However, if the query is searching for both cancelled and uncancelled flights, then it probably won't help at all. It will also take up a lot of space on the disk.
