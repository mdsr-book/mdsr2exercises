```{r bear-bid-drawer-default, include = FALSE}
mdsr2exercises::setup()
if ("package:recipes" %in% search()) {
  detach("package:recipes")
}
if ("package:fec12" %in% search()) {
  detach("package:fec12", force = TRUE)
}
if ("package:dplyr" %in% search()) {
  detach("package:dplyr", force = TRUE)
}
```

TITLE GOES HERE: The following code chunk throws an error. 

```{r error=TRUE}
mtcars %>%
  select(mpg, cyl)
```

What is the problem?
