TITLE GOES HERE: Suppose you want to visit airports in Boston (`BOS`), New York (`JFK`, `LGA`), San Francisco (`SFO`), Chicago (`ORD`, `MDW`), and Los Angeles (`LAX`). You have data about flight delays in a `tibble` called `flights`. You have written a pipeline that, for any given airport code (e.g., `LGA`), will return a `tibble` with two columns, the airport code, and the average arrival delay time. 

Suggest a workflow that would be most efficient for computing the average arrival delay time for all seven airports. 

<!--answer-start-->
Convert the pipeline into a function and iterate it over a vector containing the list of airport codes.
