TITLE GOES HERE: A data scientist working for a company that sells mortgages for new home purchases might be interested in determining what factors might be predictive of defaulting on the loan.  Some of the mortgagees have missing income 
in their data set.  Would it be reasonable for the analyst to drop these loans from their analytic data set?  Explain.


 <!--begin-answer-->
No: missing data on this important factor is likely not ignorable (see (http://www.bankrate.com/finance/mortgages/why-mortgage-lenders-want-tax-returns-1.aspx) for a discussion).
