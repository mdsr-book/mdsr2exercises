TITLE GOES HERE: Smoking is an important public health concern. Use the `NHANES` data from the `r pkg_macro(NHANES)` package to develop a logistic regression model that identifies predictors of current smoking among those 20 or older. (Hint: note that the `SmokeNow` variable is missing for those who have never smoked: you will need to recode the variable to construct your outcome variable.)

```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(NHANES)
mosaic::tally(~ SmokeNow + Smoke100, data = filter(NHANES, Age >= 20))
```
