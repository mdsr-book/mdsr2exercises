TITLE GOES HERE: Bob wants to analyze the on-time performance of United Airlines flights across the decade of the 1990s. Discuss how the partitioning scheme of the `flights` table based on `year` will affect the performance of Bob's queries, relative to an unpartitioned table. 

 <!--begin-answer-->
Bob's queries will be much faster, since the partitioning scheme will allow him to search only those ten years worth of data that are relevant. Thus, Bob will only be searching a logical table with dozens of millions of rows, instead of more than `nflights` rows. However, the partitioning scheme will not actually optimize the queries themselves---it just results in a smaller logical table.
