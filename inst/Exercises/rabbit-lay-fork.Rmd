TITLE GOES HERE: Consider the following data graphic about world-class swimmers. Emphasis is on [Katie Ledecky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie\_Ledecky), a five-time Olympic gold medalist. It may be helpful to peruse the original article, entitled "[Katie Ledecky Is The Present And The Future Of Swimming](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/katie-ledecky-is-the-present-and-the-future-of-swimming/)".

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
include_mdsr_img("morris-ledecky-2.png")
```

Suppose that the graphic was generated from a data frame like the one shown below (it wasn't---these are fake data). 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tibble::tribble(
  ~name, ~gender, ~distance, ~time_in_sd,
  "Ledecky", "F", 100, -0.8,
  "Ledecky", "F", 200, 1.7,
  "Ledecky", "F", 400, 2.9
)
```

Note: Recall that [*standard deviation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) is a measure of the spread of a set of numbers. In this case, a time that is +1 standard deviation *above* the mean is *faster* than the average time (among the top 50 times).
