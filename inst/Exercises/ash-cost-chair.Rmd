TITLE GOES HERE: How many rows are available in the `Measurements` table of the Smith College Wideband Auditory Immittance database?

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(RMySQL)
con <- dbConnect(
  MySQL(), host = "scidb.smith.edu",
  user = "waiuser", password = "smith_waiDB", 
  dbname = "wai"
)
Measurements <- tbl(con, "Measurements")
```

<!--begin-answer-->

```{r}
Measurements %>%
  group_by(NA) %>%  ## phantom group to avoid SQL translation bug?
  summarize(num_obs = n())
```

Alternatively, pulling the results into R and then counting the rows is *far* slower. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Measurements %>%
  collect() %>%
  nrow()
```
