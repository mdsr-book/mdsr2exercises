```{r kid-become-plant-default, include = FALSE}
mdsr2exercises::setup()
```

TITLE GOES HERE: Consider the following pipeline:

```{r error=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
mtcars %>%
  filter(cyl == 4) %>%
  select(mpg, cyl)
```

Rewrite this in nested form on a single line.  Which set of commands do you prefer and why?

The equivalent code written in nested form is:

`select(filter(mtcars, cyl == 4), mpg, cyl)`
