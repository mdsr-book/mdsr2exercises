Question
========

Consider the following command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
as.numeric(factor(c("1", "10", "3", "2")))
```

What is the result?

Answerlist
----------

* the `double` vector `1 2 4 3`
* the `double` vector `1 2 3 4`
* the `character` vector `1 2 4 3`
* the `double` vector `1 2 3 10`
* the `double` vector `1 10 3 2`

Solution
========

```{r, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
typeof(as.numeric(factor(c("1", "10", "3", "2"))))
```

Answerlist
----------

* Correct. 
* No, because the factor levels are ordered alphabetically.
* No, it's not a `character`.
* No, because `10` is a factor **label** but is not part of the underlying representation, the factor levels are ordered alphabetically.
* No, because `10` is a factor **label** but is not part of the underlying representation.
