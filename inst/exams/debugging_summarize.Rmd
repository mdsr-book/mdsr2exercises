Question
========

Consider the following pipeline:

```{r error=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarize(avg_mpg = mean(mpg)) %>%
  filter(am == 1)
```

The problem is:


Answerlist
----------
* There is no variable called `am` in the result of `summarize()`, because `am` does not appear in the calls to either `group_by()` or `summarize()`. 
* There is no variable called `am` in `mtcars`.
* You need to specify that `na.rm = TRUE`.
* It should say `am = 1`.

Solution
========

Answerlist
----------
* True.
* False.
* False.
* False.
