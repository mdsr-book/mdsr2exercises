Question
========

The following output shows the error message that occurs when you try to push your changes to GitHub. 

[Note that the command `git push` is the same thing as clicking the Push up-arrow in RStudio.]

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
$ git push
To https://github.com/YOU/REPO.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/YOU/REPO.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.        
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```
