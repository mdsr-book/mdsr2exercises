Question
========

The following SQL query attempts to retrieve the birthdates of people in the [IMDb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMDb) named "Michael Jordan". 
Note that this includes both [NBA legend Michael Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan) and [Black Panther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_(film)) superstar [Michael B. Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_B._Jordan). 

```{sql connection=mdsr::dbConnect_scidb("imdb"), error=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
SELECT n.id, name, info AS birthdate
FROM name AS n
LEFT JOIN person_info 
  ON n.id = pi.person_id
WHERE n.name LIKE 'Jordan, Michael%'
AND pi.info_type_id = 21;
```

However, this query returns the following error message:

```
Error in .local(conn, statement, ...) : 
  could not run statement: Unknown column 'pi.info_type_id' in 'where clause'
Calls: <Anonymous> ... engine -> <Anonymous> -> <Anonymous> -> .local -> .Call
Execution halted
```

Which of the following changes would fix the problem solely and completely (i.e., without requiring any other changes)?

* Change `pi.person_id` to `person_info.person_id` **and** change `pi.info_type_id` to `person_info.info_type_id` in the `WHERE` clause. 
* Add `AS pi` to the `SELECT` clause.
