Question
========

Suppose you want to visit airports in Boston (`BOS`), New York (`JFK`, `LGA`), San Francisco (`SFO`), Chicago (`ORD`, `MDW`), and Los Angeles (`LAX`). You have data about flight delays in a `data.frame` called `flights`. You have written a pipeline that, for any given airport code (e.g., `LGA`), will return a `data.frame` with two columns: the airport code, and the average arrival delay time. 

What workflow would be **most efficient** for computing the average arrival delay time for all seven airports? 

Answerlist
----------
* Convert the pipeline into a function and iterate it over a vector containing the list of airport codes. 
* Convert the pipeline into a function and call it on each airport code individually.
* Copy-and-paste the pipeline code seven times and then change the airport code in each one manually. 
* Phone a friend.
