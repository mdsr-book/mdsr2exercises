Question
========

The following chunk attempts to plot the path of [Hurricane Andrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Andrew), which decimated the Bahamas, Florida, and the Gulf Coast in 1992. 

```{r, message=FALSE, error=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(macleish)
library(usmap)

andrew <- storms %>%
  filter(year == 1992, name == "Andrew") %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("long", "lat")) %>%
  st_set_crs(4326) %>%
  st_transform(usmap_crs()) %>%
  summarize(do_union = FALSE) %>%
  st_cast("LINESTRING")

states <- us_map(regions = "states") %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("x", "y")) %>%
  st_set_crs(usmap_crs()) %>%
  group_by(group, full) %>%
  summarize(do_union = FALSE) %>%
  st_cast("POLYGON")

ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = states) +
  geom_sf(data = andrew, color = "blue") 
```

Which of the following commands would **compute** the polygons corresponding to only those states through which Hurricane Andrew passed? 

Answerlist
----------
* `st_intersection(states, andrew)`
* `st_intersects(states, andrew)`
* `st_union(states, andrew)`
* `st_difference(states, andrew)`
* `st_sym_difference(states, andrew)`


Solution
========

Answerlist
----------
* True.
* False. This could allow you to compute the states, but it would **not** return the polygons. 
* False.  
* False. 
* False.
