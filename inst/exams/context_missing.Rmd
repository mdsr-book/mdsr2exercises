Question
========

The following chunk creates a scatterplot of human character from [*Star Wars*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars), according to their mass and height. 

```{r, message=FALSE, fig.width=8}
library(tidyverse)
humans <- starwars %>%
  filter(species == "Human")
nrow(humans)

library(ggrepel)
ggplot(humans, aes(x = mass, y = height)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_label_repel(aes(label = name))
```

There are `r nrow(humans)` humans in the data set. 
The **Warning** claims that "13 rows containing missing values" were removed. 

Why? 

Answerlist
----------
* Because there were 13 characters for whom no `height` was recorded.
* Because there were 13 characters for whom no `mass` was recorded. 
* Because there were 13 characters for whom no `name` was recorded. 
* Because there were 13 characters for whom at least one of `height`, `mass`, or `name` was not recorded. 
* Because of the $3 * 35 = 105$ data points necessary to make the plot, 13 were missing. 


Solution
========

Answerlist
----------
* False. In fact, only four characters are missing `height`, but all of them are also missing `mass`.
* False. This is in fact true, but it's not deducible from the information given. 
* False. None of the characters are missing `name`.
* True.
* False. In fact, 17 data points are missing.
