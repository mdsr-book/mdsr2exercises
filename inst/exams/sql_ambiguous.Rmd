Question
========

The following SQL query attempts to retrieve the birthdates of people in the [IMDb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMDb) named "Michael Jordan". 
Note that this includes both [NBA legend Michael Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan) and [Black Panther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_(film)) superstar [Michael B. Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_B._Jordan). 

```{sql connection=mdsr::dbConnect_scidb("imdb"), error=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
SELECT id, name, info AS birthdate
FROM name
LEFT JOIN person_info 
  ON name.id = person_info.person_id
WHERE name LIKE 'Jordan, Michael%'
AND info_type_id = 21;
```

However, this query returns the following error message:

```
Error in .local(conn, statement, ...) : 
  could not run statement: Column 'id' in field list is ambiguous
Calls: <Anonymous> ... engine -> <Anonymous> -> <Anonymous> -> .local -> .Call
Execution halted
```

What is the problem?


Answerlist
----------
* There is a column named `id` in both the `person_info` and `name` tables. 
* In the `ON` clause, it should say `imdb.name.id`.
* In the `ON` clause, it should say `person_info.id`.
* In the `ON` clause, it should say `name.person_id`.
* In the `FROM` clause, it should say `name AS n`.

Solution
========

Answerlist
----------
* True.
* False. This won't solve the problem. 
* False. That would be incorrect match. 
* False. There is no column called `person_id` in `name`.
* False. That won't help.
