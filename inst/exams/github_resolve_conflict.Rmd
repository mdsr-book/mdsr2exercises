Question
========

The following output shows a merge conflict in a file named `mp2.Rmd`. 

```
<<<<<<< HEAD:mp2.Rmd
babynames %>%
  filter(name == "Benjamin")
-------
babynames %>%
  filter(name %in% c("Ben", "Benito"))
  group_by(name)
>>>>>>> issue-5:mp2.Rmd
```

Which of the following statements are true? 

Answerlist
----------
* The conflict occurred because two people tried to edit the same part of the same file. 
* The conflict must be resolved manually because `git` has no way of knowing which of the two code chunks you prefer. 
* The conflict can be resolved by just deleting line 4 (`=======`)
* The conflict can be resolved by deleting lines 1, 4, and 8. 
* The best way to resolve the conflict is by deleting lines 1, 4, and 8, and also resolving the discrepancies in the code.
