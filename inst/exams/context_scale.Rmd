Question
========

Consider the following data graphic from the *Economist* article, "[Temporary economic downturns have long-lasting consequences](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/10/19/temporary-economic-downturns-have-long-lasting-consequences)":

![](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/20181020_WOC966.png)

Notice that the labels on the $x$-axis are given in odd numbers of years since graduation (i.e., 1, 3, 5, 7, ...).
Suppose that you wanted to change these to even numbers (i.e., 2, 4, 6, 8, ...). 
What function would you use to change the labels on the $x$-axis? 

Answerlist
----------
* `scale_x_continuous()`, because "Years since graduation" is a continuous variable.
* `scale_x_discrete()`, because "Years since graduation" is a discrete variable.
* `scale_color_discrete()`, because "Years since graduation" is a discrete variable.
* `labs()`, because the numbers are labels
* `geom_text()`, because the labels are text


Solution
========

Answerlist
----------
* True.
* False. Although it's possible that "Years since graduation" could be coded as a categorical variable, that would make it impossible to draw the lines representing the actual data. 
* False. That scale only works for color.
* False. You could change the **name** of the axis this way, but not the labels.
* False. That function displays text on the data graphic itself, not on the axes.
