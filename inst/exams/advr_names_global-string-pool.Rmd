Question
========

Consider the following block of code:

```{r}
x <- letters[1:5]
lobstr::ref(x, character = TRUE)

x[3] <- "I love R!"
```

```{r}
lobstr::ref(x)
```

Aside from that, how many of five memory locations for the **five values** in `x` (shown in lines 2--6 of the output above) have changed?
