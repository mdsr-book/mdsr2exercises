Question
========

Consider the following block of code:

```{r}
random_values <- rnorm(10)
my_values <- random_values
```

Which of the following statements are true?

Answerlist
----------

* `my_values` and `random_values` are two distinct objects, so they occupy different locations in memory.
* `my_values` occupies the same location in memory as `random_values`.
* Whether `my_values` and `random_values` occupy the same location in memory depends on which random values were chosen by the random number generator.

Solution
========

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
lobstr::ref(random_values)
lobstr::ref(my_values)
```

Answerlist
----------

* False, they are not "distinct" objects in that sense.
* True.
* False, it doesn't matter what random values were drawn.
