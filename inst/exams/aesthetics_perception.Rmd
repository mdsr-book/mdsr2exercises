Which of the following critiques are valid, as supported by the data visualization literature? 

Answerlist
----------
* A pie chart is inferior to a bar chart because angle is lower on the perceptual hierarchy than length.
* Distortion is introduced by the 3D effect, because the area of the image consumed by each slice of pie is no longer proportional to the data values. 
* The categorical color palette is a poor choice, because the colors have vastly different saturation levels (i.e., intensities). 
* The categorical color palette is a good choice, because the colors are perceptually very similar. 


Solution
