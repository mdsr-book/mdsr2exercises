Question
========

The following SQL query attempts to retrieve the birthdates of people in the [IMDb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMDb) named "Michael Jordan". 
Note that this includes both [NBA legend Michael Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan) and [Black Panther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_(film)) superstar [Michael B. Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_B._Jordan). 

```{sql connection=mdsr::dbConnect_scidb("imdb"), error=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
SELECT n.id, name, info AS birthdate
WHERE n.name LIKE 'Jordan, Michael%'
  AND pi.info_type_id = 21
FROM name AS n
LEFT JOIN person_info 
  ON n.id = pi.person_id;
```

However, this query returns the following error message:

```
Error in .local(conn, statement, ...) : 
  You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'WHERE n.name LIKE 'Jordan, Michael%'   AND pi.info_type_id = 21 FROM name AS n L' at line 2
Calls: <Anonymous> ... engine -> <Anonymous> -> <Anonymous> -> .local -> .Call
Execution halted
```

What is the problem? 

Answerlist
----------
* The `WHERE` clause must come *after* the `FROM` clause, not before. 
* The `LEFT JOIN` clause must come *before* the `FROM` clause, not after. 
* The `FROM` clause should come first. 
* The `HAVING` clause is missing, and it's required. 
* The `ORDER BY` clause is missing, and it's required. 


Solution

Answerlist
----------
* True.
* False. The `JOIN` clause is technically part of the `FROM` clause, but must come after the word `FROM`
* False. The `SELECT` clause must come first.
* False. The `HAVING` clause is optional.
* False. The `ORDER BY` clause is optional.
