Question
========

The `starwars` data frame is provided by the `dplyr` package, and contains information about characters from the [*Star Wars*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars) movie franchise.  

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
starwars
```

Unfortunately, you have never seen any of the *Star Wars* movies and you don't understand what some of the variables (e.g., `homeworld`, `species`) refer to, or what some of the values (e.g., "Tatooine") mean. 

What can you do to get more information?
