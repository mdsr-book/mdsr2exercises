Question
========

Consider the following data graphic created by this chunk of code:

```{r mtcars-geom-point, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = disp, y = mpg), color = am) + 
  geom_point()
```

Why aren't the points colored? 

Answerlist
----------
* Because the mapping of `color` to the `am` variable occurs outside of the `aes()` function.
* Because there is no variable in `mtcars` called `am`.
* Because you need to put the `color = am` specification inside `geom_point()`.
* Because you need `fill = am` instead of `color = am`.
* Because you need quotation marks around `am`. 


Solution
========

Answerlist
----------
* True.
* False, there is a variable called `am`.
* False. It still won't work unless you put it in `aes()`
* False. 
* False. That would references a different object, but still not produce color.
