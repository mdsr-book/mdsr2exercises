Question
========

In the following paper, the authors argue that economies can grow even after implementing austerity measures. 

- Reinhart, C. M., & Rogoff, K. S. (2010). [Growth in a Time of Debt](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w15639/w15639.pdf). *American Economic Review*, 100(2), 573-78.

It was later discovered that these findings were the result of an error in the calculations made on a spreadsheet. 

- Herndon, T., Ash, M., & Pollin, R. (2014). [Does high public debt consistently stifle economic growth? A critique of Reinhart and Rogoff](https://doi.org/10.1093/cje/bet075). *Cambridge Journal of Economics*, 38(2), 257-279. 

Which of the following statements is **false**?

Answerlist
----------
* Reinhart and Rogoff honored their professional obligations by providing reasonable access to their software and data. 
* If Herndon had not attempted to reproduce Reinhart and Rogoff's result, the error might never have been detected. 
* The error would likely have been easier to detect if the analysis had been done in a scriptable language (like R or Python) instead of a spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel), because formulas in spreadsheets are obscured and easy to manipulate.
* Since the error was ultimately detected, there was no harm done.
