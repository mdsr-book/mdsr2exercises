Question
========

Consider the following function definition, and subsequent call of that function. 

```{r, error=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

summarize_species <- function(pattern = "Human") {
  x <- starwars %>%
    filter(species == pattern) %>%
    summarize(
      num_people = n(),
      avg_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
}

summarize_species("Wookiee")
x
```

What causes this error? 

Answerlist
----------
* `x` is a local variable that only exists within the execution of the function `summarize_species()`, and doesn't exist in the global environment. 
* the function needs to end with `return(x)`.
* `starwars` doesn't exist in the global environment.
* `x` is a global variable that always exists.

Solution
