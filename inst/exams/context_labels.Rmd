Question
========

The following chunk creates a bar graph of median yearly income among states, as captured by the 2017 American Community Survey. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8}
library(tidyverse)
us_income <- us_rent_income %>%
  filter(variable == "income")

ggplot(us_income, aes(x = NAME, y = estimate)) + 
  geom_col()
```

Each bar represents one state (or territory). 
The state names appear on the $x$-axis, but they are impossible to read because they are overlapping. 

Which of the following alterations would likely improve the readability of the plot? 

Answerlist
----------
* Use `coord_flip()` to switch the $x$ and $y$ axes, because that would create more horizontal space for the state names. 
* Use `scale_y_continuous()` to specify that the median income (in US dollars) is being plotted on the $y$ axis.
* Divide the income values by 1000, then specify the units in the $y$ axis as "thousands of US dollars".
* Reorder the bars so they are in order of median income, because alphabetical order doesn't mean much for states. 
* Use the `labels` argument to `scale_y_continous()` to add a dollar sign (`$`).
* Remove `NAME` from the $x$-axis, because it just takes up space and it's pretty obvious what the $x$ variable is. 
* Add a title and subtitle that specifies what the plot is showing.
