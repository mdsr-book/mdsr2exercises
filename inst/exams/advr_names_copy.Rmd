Question
========

Suppose that `my_var` and `your_var` are both lists with three items that are bound to the same memory address. 

```{r}
my_var <- list("alpha", "beta", "delta")
your_var <- my_var

library(lobstr)
ref(my_var)
ref(your_var)
```

If I modify the second value in `my_var`, then R has to create a ________, since now `my_var` and `your_var` are different and thus cannot occupy the same location in memory.

Choose the correct word to fill in the blank.
