Question
========

Consider the following function definition, and subsequent call of that function. 

```{r, error=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

summarize <- function(data, pattern = "Human") {
  data %>%
    filter(species == pattern) %>%
    summarize(
      num_people = n(),
      avg_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
}

summarize("Wookiee")
```

Which of the following statements are true?

Answerlist
----------
* the function call `summarize("Wookiee")` launches the user-defined function `summarize()`.
* the function call `summarize("Wookiee")` launches the `summarize()` function from the `dplyr` package.
* it's a bad idea to name the user-defined function `summarize()`, because it will conflict with the `summarize()` function from the `dplyr` package. 
* calling a function within itself like this is not allowed in R because functions in R can't be [recursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)). 
* the function call `summarize("Wookiee")` throws an error because there are no such things as [Wookiees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wookiee). 

Solution
========

Answerlist
----------
* True.
* False. The user-defined function masks `dplyr::summarize()`
* True.
* False. Recursive functions are allowed in R, this one just doesn't work. 
* False. Wookiees *do* exist in the data set.
