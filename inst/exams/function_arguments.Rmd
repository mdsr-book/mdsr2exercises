Question
========

Consider the following function definition, and subsequent call of that function. 

```{r, error=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

summarize_species <- function(data, pattern = "Human") {
  data %>%
    filter(species == pattern) %>%
    summarize(
      num_people = n(),
      avg_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
}

summarize_species("Wookiee")
```

What is the problem that causes the error?

Answerlist
----------
* the `filter()` function expects a `data.frame`, but gets a `character` vector
* you need to specify `pattern = "Wookiee"`
* there is no object called `data` in the global environment
* there is a mismatch between `Human` and `Wookiee`

Solution
========

Answerlist
----------
* True.
* False. That will not solve the problem because there is no default for the `data` argument. 
* False. It's not looking for `data` in the global environment. 
* False. There is no mismatch.
