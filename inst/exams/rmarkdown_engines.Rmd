Question
========


```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  error = TRUE
)
```

The following chunk throws an error, even though the code is a perfectly valid SQL expression.

```{r}
DESCRIBE title;
```

The chunk appears like this in the R Markdown source document:

````
```{r}`r ''`
DESCRIBE title;
```
````

How can the problem be fixed? 

Answerlist
----------
* Change the chunk type (i.e., engine) from `r` to `sql`.
* Change the expression to `EXPLAIN title;`
* Change the expression to `explain TITLE;`
* Add the `eval = TRUE` argument. 
* Add the `error = TRUE` argument. 


Solution
========

Answerlist
----------
* True. 
* False. That won't solve the problem. 
* False. That won't solve the problem. 
* False. It is already being evaluated -- that's why you see the error.
* False. The `error` argument is already set to `TRUE`.
