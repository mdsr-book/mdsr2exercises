Question
========

The following SQL query attempts to retrieve the birthdates of people in the [IMDb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMDb) named "Michael Jordan". 
Note that this includes both [NBA legend Michael Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan) and [Black Panther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_(film)) superstar [Michael B. Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_B._Jordan). 

```{sql connection=mdsr::dbConnect_scidb("imdb"), error=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
SELECT n.id, name, info AS birthdate
FROM name AS n
LEFT JOIN person_info AS pi
  ON n.id = pi.id
WHERE n.name LIKE 'Jordan, Michael%'
AND pi.info_type_id = 21;
```

This query does not throw an error, but returns no results. 
Since we know that at least two actors in the database are named Michael Jordan, this result is wrong. 

What went wrong?
