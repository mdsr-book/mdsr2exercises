Question
========

Consider the following function definition, and subsequent call of that function. 

```{r, error=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

select <- function(pattern = "Human") {
  starwars %>%
    filter(species == pattern) %>%
    summarize(
      num_people = n(),
      avg_height = mean(height, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
}

select("Wookiee")
```

This works, and gives the correct answer. 

Why is the name `select` a poor choice for this function? 

Answerlist
----------
* It doesn't accurately describe what the function does. 
* It conflicts with the existing (and more widely-used) function called `select()` from the `dplyr` package. 
* Function names should always include a period (`.`). 
* Function names should always include an underscore (`_`).
