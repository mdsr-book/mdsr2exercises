Question
========

The following chunk attempts to plot the path of [Hurricane Andrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Andrew), which decimated the Bahamas, Florida, and the Gulf Coast in 1992. 

```{r, message=FALSE, error=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
storms %>%
  filter(year == 1992, name == "Andrew") %>%
  select(name, lat, long) %>%
  ggplot(aes(color = name)) +
  geom_sf()
```

Why doesn't this code work? 

Answerlist
----------
* Because the input into `ggplot()` is not an `sf` object.
* Because the `data` argument to `ggplot()` is not specified.
* Because the call to `aes()` needs to be inside `geom_sf()`. 
* Because there is no column called `geometry` in `storms`.
* Because `lat` and `long` are in the wrong order. 
* Because the `+` should be a `%>%` on the second-to-last line.

Solution
========

Answerlist
----------
* True.
* False. It is specified by the pipe on the previous line.
* False. It could be there or where it is. 
* False. Even if there were such a column, the `select()` statement would drop it. 
* False. This doesn't matter in this application. 
* False. `ggplot` uses the `+`, not the `%>%`.
