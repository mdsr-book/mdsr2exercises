Which of the following statements are true? 

Answerlist
----------
* You can tell that this is not a Mercator projection because the [49th parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/49th_parallel_north) (along the northern border of Montana, etc.) is curved and not straight. 
* This maps distorts reality, since the percentage of the area on the map that is blue is not proportional to the percentage of electoral votes won by Biden. 
* [Electoral votes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_college) are allocated to each state based on its *population*. But on the map, each state takes up visual space based on its *area*. 
* The map would likely be improved by having states with fewer electoral votes appear in a more neutral color. 
* [Alaska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska) is smaller than [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas).
