Question
========

Consider the following data graphic. 

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point()
```

The `am` variable takes the value `0` if the car has [automatic transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_transmission) and `1` if the car has [manual transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission). 
How could you differentiate the cars in the graphic based on their transmission type? 

Answerlist
----------
* map the color aesthetic to the `am` variable in `ggplot()`
* map the color aesthetic to the `am` variable in `geom_point()`
* map the shape aesthetic to the `am` variable in `geom_point()`
* map the geom aesthetic to the `am` variable in `ggplot()`
* add a `facet_wrap()` on the `am` variable


Solution
