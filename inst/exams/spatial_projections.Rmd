Question
========

Consider the following two projections of the world.
The map on the left shows the [Mercator projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection).
The map on the right shows the [Gall-Peters projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gall%E2%80%93Peters_projection).

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.show='hold', out.width="50%"}
library(mapproj)
library(maps)
map("world", projection = "mercator", wrap = TRUE)
map("world", projection = "cylequalarea", param = 45, wrap = TRUE)
```

Which of the following statements are true?

Answerlist
----------
* The Mercator projection is very commonly used in the United States. 
* The Mercator projection distorts the relative size of land masses. Those closer to the North or South Pole appear much larger than they actually are. 
* Africa is actually 14 times larger than Greenland. 
* The Gall-Peters projection is an equal-area projection, meaning that it preserves areas. 
* The Gall-Peters projection is conformal, meaning that it preserves angles locally. 
* The different properties of the Mercator vs. Gall-Peters projections were notably at the center of controversy surrounding the notion of cartographic imperialism.
