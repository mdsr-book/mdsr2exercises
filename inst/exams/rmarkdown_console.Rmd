<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Searching for good analogy for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#rstats</a> Console vs. R Markdown document. Does having a conversation vs. writing a speech work?</p>&mdash; Ben Baumer (@BaumerBen) <a href="https://twitter.com/BaumerBen/status/907281798585077760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 11, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Which of the following statements support this analogy?
