The following SQL queries retrieve the birthdates of people in the [IMDb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMDb) named "Michael Jordan".

```{sql connection=mdsr::dbConnect_scidb("imdb"), error=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
EXPLAIN
SELECT n.id, name, info AS birthdate
FROM name AS n
LEFT JOIN person_info 
  ON n.id = person_info.id
WHERE n.name LIKE 'Jordan, Michael%'
AND person_info.info_type_id = 21;
```

```{sql connection=DBI::dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), host="scidb.smith.edu", user="sds192", password="DSismfc@S", db="imdb"), error=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
EXPLAIN
SELECT id, info AS birthdate
FROM person_info 
WHERE id IN (

)
AND info_type_id = 21;
