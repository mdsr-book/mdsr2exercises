Question
========

In the following paper, the authors put forth an algorithm that predicts a person's sexual orientation based on a picture of their face:

- Wang, Y., & Kosinski, M. (2018). [Deep neural networks are more accurate than humans at detecting sexual orientation from facial images](https://doi.org/10.1037/pspa0000098). Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 114(2), 246â€“257. 

Which of the following statements are true?

Answerlist
----------
* This algorithm could be used to discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation.
* There are no ethical issues with this algorithm.
* This algorithm is faulty because it was trained on a set of faces that were overwhelming white. 
* Ben thinks that the authors cannot be blamed, because they are just making an algorithm and they can't control how people use it. 
* This algorithm is 100% accurate and that makes is OK.

Solution

Answerlist
----------
* True.
* False. There are plenty of ethical issues!
* True. 
* False. I think they should have thought of this ahead of time. 
* False. No algorithm like this is 100% accurate, and that wouldn't make it OK.
