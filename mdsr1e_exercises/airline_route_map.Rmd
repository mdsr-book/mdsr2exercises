## Extended example: Historical airline route maps

`r index_entry("subject", "airline route maps")`
`r index_entry("subject", "maps!airline route")`
`r index_entry("subject", "juvenile pleasures")`
One of the more juvenile pleasures of flying is reading the material in the seat pocket in front of you. The amount of information that the airline is willing to tell you about their business never ceases to amaze. In addition to the layout of the terminals for the airports that the airlines serves, they always show a domestic airlines route map. But while those old route maps are probably long gone, the `r mdsr_data("airlines")` data gives us the ability to resurrect *historical* airline route maps---for any airline. 

<!--%  To cast a regular `data.frame` into a spatial object, you have to specify the columns in the data frame that you want to designate as coordinates. To do this, use the `coordinates()` command. Recall that the **airlines** data set contains the latitude and longitude of each airport. -->

`r index_entry("subject", "Northwest Airlines")`
`r index_entry("subject", "Delta Airlines")`
To start, let's specify a carrier and a year. In this case we will work with Delta Airlines before their merger with Northwest Airlines in 2008. 

```{r }
library(sf)
my_carrier <- "DL"
my_year <- 2016
```

Next, we can use these values as parameters to a query to our `r pkg("airlines")` database. To make an informative map, we will need two pieces of information: a list of airports and the number of flights that it handled that year, and a list of all the segments that the carrier flew that year. First we will make connections to the `r mdsr_data("flights")` and `r mdsr_data("airports")` tables, respectively. 

`r index_entry("R", "library(airlines)")`
`r index_entry("R", "src_scidb()")`
`r index_entry("R", "tbl()")`
```{r eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
db <- src_scidb("airlines")
airports <- tbl(db, "airports")
flights <- tbl(db, "flights")
```

`r index_entry("subject", "SQL")`
`r index_entry("subject", "MySQL!syntax")`
To find the airports that the airline services, we'll query the `r mdsr_data("flights")` table, but join on the `r mdsr_data("airports")` table to retrieve the name and location of the airport.[^mysql]

[^mysql]: Note the use of MySQL syntax in defining the `r variable("name")` field. This was necessary because both `r mdsr_data("flights")` and `r mdsr_data("airports")` are `src_mysql` objects. See Section \@ref(sec:dplyr-sql) for a further explanation.

```{r dests, warning=FALSE}
destinations <- flights %>%
  filter(year == my_year, carrier == my_carrier) %>%
  left_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(
    N = n(), lon = max(lon), lat = max(lat), 
    # note use of MySQL syntax instead of dplyr
    name = min(CONCAT("(", dest, ") ", 
                      REPLACE(name, " Airport", "")))
  ) %>%
  collect() %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("lon", "lat")) %>%
  st_set_crs(4326)
glimpse(destinations)
```

`r index_entry("subject", "edge")`
`r index_entry("subject", "segments")`
`r index_entry("subject", "airport")`
Next, we need to know about the flights between each airport that will make up the segments in our map. How many flights went between each pair of airports?  

`r index_entry("R", "na.omit()")`
`r index_entry("R", "dim()")`
`r index_entry("R", "left_join()")`
`r index_entry("R", "group_by()")`
`r index_entry("R", "summarize()")`
```{r segments, warning=FALSE}
segments <- flights %>%
  filter(year == my_year, carrier == my_carrier) %>%
  group_by(origin, dest) %>% 
  summarize(N = n()) %>%
  left_join(airports, by = c("origin" = "faa")) %>%
  left_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) %>%
  collect() %>%
  na.omit()
dim(segments)
```

To plot our segments correctly, we have to convert them to a `sf` object. First, we will create separate `sf` objects for the origins and destinations, each of which will be `POINT` geometries. For each segment (e.g., `JFK` to `SFO`), there will be one row in `origins` with the location information for the origin airport, and another row in `dests` with the location information for the destination airport. 

```{r segments-sf}
origins <- segments %>%
  select(origin, dest, lat.x, lon.x) %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("lon.x", "lat.x")) %>%
  ungroup()

dests <- segments %>%
  select(origin, dest, lat.y, lon.y) %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("lon.y", "lat.y")) %>%
  ungroup()
```

Second, we will combine these two data frames, and then aggregate them using `r func("group_by")`. Now, each segment will be matched with the location information for both airports. Those two `POINT` geometries will by combined by `r func("summarize")` into a `MULTIPOINT` geometry. We then convert that `MULTIPOINT` geometry into a `LINESTRING` geometry using `r func("st_cast")`. 

`r index_entry("R", "rbind()")`
`r index_entry("R", "group_by()")`
`r index_entry("R", "summarize()")`
`r index_entry("R", "st_set_crs()")`
`r index_entry("R", "st_cast()")`
```{r}
segments_sf <- rbind(origins, dests) %>%
  group_by(origin, dest) %>%
  summarize(num_points = n()) %>%
  st_cast("LINESTRING") %>%
  st_set_crs(4326)

segments_sf
```

Note that there were `r nrow(destinations)` in service, but only `r nrow(segments)` unique pairs of airports (in either direction). Thus, Delta served only `r round(100 * nrow(segments) / nrow(destinations)^2)`% of the possible flight routes among these airports. 

### Using `ggplot2`

`r index_entry("R", "library(ggplot2)")`
Since we have the geographic coordinates of the airports, we can make a map of the Delta hubs using `r pkg("ggplot2")`. We will plot the airports as semi-transparent gray dots, with the area of each dot proportional to the number of flights that it served. Note that `r pkg("ggplot2")` automatically scales points by area. 

`r index_entry("R", "geom_point()")`
`r index_entry("R", "scale_size()")`
`r index_entry("R", "theme_void()")`
```{r delta-hub-map, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.cap="Airports served by Delta Airlines in 2006."}
route_map <- ggplot() +
  ggspatial::annotation_map_tile(zoom = 4, type = "osm") + 
  geom_sf(
    data = destinations, alpha = 0.5, 
    aes(size = N)
  ) + 
  scale_size() + 
  theme_void()
route_map
```

`r index_entry("subject", "Atlanta, GA")`
`r index_entry("subject", "Salt Lake City, UT")`
`r index_entry("subject", "Cincinnati, OH")`
`r index_entry("subject", "New York, NY")`
`r index_entry("subject", "Minneapolis--St. Paul")`
`r index_entry("subject", "Detroit, MI")`
Note that the Delta hubs in Atlanta, Salt Lake City, Cincinnati, and New York are immediately obvious in Figure \@ref(fig:delta-hub-map). However, the additional hubs in Minneapolis--St. Paul and Detroit, are not present---these were acquired through the merger with Northwest. At the time, Atlanta served more than five times as many flights as Salt Lake City. 

```{r }
destinations %>% arrange(desc(N))
```

`r index_entry("subject", "Delta Airlines")`
However, it remains to draw the segments connecting each airport. Here again, we will use the frequency of such segments to change the color of the lines. 
Figure \@ref(fig:delta-route-map) shows the Delta Airlines network in `r my_year`.

```{r delta-route-map, warning=FALSE, fig.height=8, fig.cap="Full route map for Delta Airlines in 2006."}
route_map + 
  geom_sf(data = segments_sf$geometry, aes(color = segments_sf$num_points), 
    size = 0.05, arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm"))
  )
```


### Using `leaflet`

`r index_entry("subject", "leaflet")`

To make our map in `r pkg("leaflet")`, we simply have to use the `r func("addCircles")` function to add the circle markers for each airport, and the `r func("addPolylines")` function to add the lines for each segment. A static image of the interactive plot is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:delta).

`r index_entry("subject", "add circles")`
`r index_entry("subject", "circles")`
`r index_entry("R", "addCircles()")`
`r index_entry("R", "addPolylines()")`
`r index_entry("R", "setView()")`
`r index_entry("R", "library(leaflet)")`
```{r eval=TRUE}
library(leaflet)
l_map <- leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  addCircles(
    data = destinations, weight = 1, 
    radius = ~sqrt(N) * 500, popup = ~name
  ) %>%
  addPolylines(data = segments_sf, weight = 0.4) %>%
  setView(lng = -80, lat = 38, zoom = 6)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
mdsr::save_webshot(l_map, "gfx/leaflet-airlines.png")
```

```{r delta, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Interactive map from a `r pkg('leaflet')` plot of the historical Delta airlines route map."}
# knitr::include_graphics("gfx/leaflet-airlines.png")
l_map
```
