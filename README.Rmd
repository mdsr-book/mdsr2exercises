The goal of the **mdsr2exercises** packages is to provide exercises for the 2nd edition of *Modern Data Science with R*. 

## Installation

Install from [GitHub](https://github.com):
 

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
#install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("beanumber/etude")
remotes::install_github("mdsr-book/mdsr2exercises")
```

## Summary

This package contains the following set of exercises:

```{r load, message=FALSE}
library(mdsr2exercises)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
```

```{r table, results = "asis"}
summary_table <- mdsr_exercise_all() %>%
  group_by(chapter, difficulty) %>%
  filter(!grepl("onlineonly", tags)) %>%
  count() %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = difficulty, values_from = n) %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(N = sum(c_across(where(is.numeric)), na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(N)) %>%
  relocate(chapter, Easy, Medium) %>%
  janitor::adorn_totals("row") 
knitr::kable(summary_table)
```

Here is the summary of the online only exercises:

```{r online, results = "asis"}
summary_table <- mdsr_exercise_all() %>%
  group_by(chapter, difficulty) %>%
  filter(grepl("onlineonly", tags)) %>%
  count() %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = difficulty, values_from = n) %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(N = sum(c_across(where(is.numeric)), na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(N)) %>%
  relocate(chapter, Easy, Medium) %>%
  janitor::adorn_totals("row") 
knitr::kable(summary_table)
```




## Example

We can build a `tibble` of exercises that you want to show.
Also specify any options, as documented in `etude::etude_list()`.
Here, we show how to display the first two exercises associated with a particular chapter.

```{r exercises, results = "asis", message=FALSE}
exercises <- mdsr_exercise_ls(chapter == "data-I") %>%
  select(-author, -date) %>%
  head(2)
knitr::kable(exercises)
```


Second, give the in-line command `knit_mdsr_exercises(exercises)`:

## Exercises

`r knit_mdsr_exercises(exercises)`

## Exercises with answers

To display answers, add the `show_answers = TRUE` option.

## Creating new exercises

Exercises are stored in `inst/Exercises`. To create a new exercise, call `mdsr_exercise_new()`. 

Please also see the [**etude** template vignette](https://github.com/dtkaplan/etude/blob/master/vignettes/templates.Rmd)

## Quizzes

**mdsr2exercises** also contains quiz and exam questions in the **exams** format. 

The `write_moodle()` function wraps `exams::exams2moodle()` to create XML files that can be imported into Moodle. 

```{r write-moodle, eval=FALSE}
write_moodle(
  pattern = "wrangling", 
  quiz_name = "wrangling", 
  dir = tempdir()
)
```
